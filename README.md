# ALX Software Engineering DevOps Repository
Feel free to go through this repository and be sure to give a star if you learnt something new ðŸ˜Š

## Description
At ALX School `we do hard things`, the goal is not to be a good student rather the key goal is to be a good software Engineer. We have projects everyday that we have to push on GitHub in order for an automatic review to be done, and we do this using `Ubuntu 20.04 LTS`. This repository contains directories each corresponding to a software engineering or DevOps project. These projects are part of the ALX Software Engineering year 1 curriculum. Feel free to checkout these directories if you are new to working on the terminal. In these projects, we cover everything from the basics of the Linux Shell, Bash commands, Bash scripting, networking, APIs, and web-stack debugging to more advanced topics.
